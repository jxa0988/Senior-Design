# Website Instructions for cloning the backend MAKE SURE TIME ZONE SYNC, DEPENDANCIES INSTALL, DONT USE PYTHON MICROSOFT INSTALL!

1. `pip install uv`
2. `cd backend` first, because `manage.py` is inside this folder.
3. `pip sync`
4. Put the `.env` and `key.json` files in the `backend` folder.
5. Run `uv run python manage.py runserver` while you are still inside `backend`.
6. The frontend also needs to be running. `localhost:8000/api/login` is the backend login page and it redirects to `localhost:8080`.
